## The Project: 
# [BLS-jUMP-KIT](https://front-end-capstone-532c6.firebaseapp.com)

Intended to aid Emergency Medical Technicians in completing assessments efficiently in real time. As a former EMT, I have experienced many clumsy UI's. It was important to me to make something that would help an EMT from their forst day in the field to their last. As a result of a flexible design, users can choose what assesmentst to perform based on the needs of the patient.
Features include: 
* HIPPA compliant patient data tracking
* OAuth, database, and deployment using Firebase
* Convenient & fast Google Login
* Bootstrap multi-select dropdown menus with search for fast, flexible user selection
* CSS animated second hand on navbar logo to aid in taking pulse/respiratory rate
